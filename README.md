# Deferent_Storage
LocalDB (Local Database):
LocalDB typically refers to a lightweight, single-user database that is stored locally on a user's device, such as a computer or a mobile device. It's often used in applications where a small-scale database is required for offline data storage and retrieval. LocalDBs are not designed for heavy concurrent usage or for sharing data among multiple users. Examples include SQLite, which is a popular choice for embedding databases within applications.

IndexedDB (Indexed Database):
IndexedDB is a browser-based database technology primarily used for web applications. It's designed to store larger amounts of structured data on the client side, allowing web applications to function offline and maintain data across sessions. IndexedDB is an object-oriented database that uses indexes for efficient data retrieval. It's commonly used to build Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and other web applications that need to store data locally within a user's browser.

SessionDB (Session Database):
SessionDB doesn't seem to be a widely recognized term in the context of databases. However, the concept of a session database could refer to a database or data store that is used to manage session-related information in a web application. Sessions are used to maintain state between a user and a web server, and a session database could be used to store and manage session IDs, user authentication tokens, and related data.

SQL (Structured Query Language):
SQL is not a type of database, but rather a language used to communicate with and manipulate relational databases. Relational databases organize data into structured tables with rows and columns, and SQL provides a standardized way to query, insert, update, and delete data in these databases. Popular relational database management systems (RDBMS) that use SQL include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle Database.
